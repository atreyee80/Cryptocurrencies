# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Overview
With the help of unsupervised machine learning methodology to investigate a dataset of different cryptocurrencies and develop trends to deliver an investment portfolio to Martha's firm, Accountability Accounting. During this process, we learned how to cluster, transform and process data by reducing data dimensions and principal companents using PCA

## Resources
Data Sources provided to analyze and minipulate included:

crypto_data.csv
Software utilized for this study included:

Python 3.8.2
Pandas
Personal GitHub account

## Analysis/Workflow/Results

 Specifically for this deliverable we did the following:

1. Read in the crypto_data.csv to the Pandas DataFrame named crypto_df.
2. Keep all the cryptocurrencies that are being traded.
3. Drop the IsTrading column.
4. Remove rows that have at least one null value.
5. Filter the drop_CoinName DataFrame so it only has rows where coins have been mined.
6. Create a new DataFrame that holds only the cryptocurrency names, and use the drop_CoinName DataFrame index as the index for this new DataFrame.
7.Remove the CoinName column from the drop_CoinName DataFrame since it's not going to be used on the clustering algorithm (see below).

8. Use the get_dummies() method to create variables for the two text features, Algorithm and ProofType, and store the resulting data in a new DataFrame named X.
9. Use the StandardScaler fit_transform() function to standardize the features from the X DataFrame.

# Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Specifically for this deliverable we did the following:

1. Continue using the crypto_clustering.ipynb file from Deliverable 1 where you’ve already performed the preprocessing steps.
2.Using the information we’ve provided, apply PCA to reduce the dimensions to three principal components.
3. Create a new DataFrame named pcs_df that includes the following columns, PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3, and uses the index of the crypto_df DataFrame as the index (see below).

## Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Specifically for this deliverable we did the following:

1. Continue using the crypto_clustering.ipynb file that you used in Deliverable 2 to reduce the dataset to three dimensions.
2. Using the pcs_df DataFrame, create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K (see below).

3. Use the pcs_df DataFrame to run the K-means algorithm to make predictions of the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data.
4. Create a new DataFrame named clustered_df by concatenating the drop_CoinName and pcs_df DataFrames on the same columns. The index should be the same as the drop_CoinName DataFrame.
5. Add the CoinName column that holds the names of the cryptocurrencies, which you created in Step 7 of Deliverable 1, to the clustered_df.
6. Add another new column to the clustered_df named Class that holds the predictions, i.e., model.labels_, from Step 3 (see below).

## Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
Specifically for this deliverable we did the following:

1. Continue using the crypto_clustering.ipynb file from Deliverable 3 where you have predicted the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data.
2. Create a 3D scatter plot using the Plotly Express scatter_3d() function to plot the three clusters from the clustered_df DataFrame (see below).

3. Add the CoinName and Algorithm columns to the hover_name and hover_data parameters, respectively, so each data point shows the CoinName and Algorithm on hover.
4. Create a table with tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function (see below).
![](3dscatter_PCA.png?raw=true)
5. Print the total number of tradable cryptocurrencies in the clustered_df DataFrame.
6. Use the MinMaxScaler().fit_transform method to scale the TotalCoinSupply and TotalCoinsMined columns between the given range of zero and one.
7. Create a new DataFrame using the clustered_df DataFrame index that contains the scaled data you created in Step 5 (see below).
8. Add the CoinName column from the clustered_df DataFrame to the new DataFrame.
9. Add the Class column from the clustered_df DataFrame to the new DataFrame (see below).
